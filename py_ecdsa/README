chatgpt3.5: fine (tested manually with openssl cli, code also seems fine)
chatgpt4: couldn't veryfy the signature even with manual code fixes,
but it definitely hashes the message twice
(see the sign method and run `isinstance(..., ellipticcurve.CurveEdTw)`)
openassistant:
	sample1: XXX
	(invalid methods,
	invalid function arguments count,
	completely invalid package/function choice)
	sample2: XXX
	(invalid import,
	such a method doesn't exist)
